        <h1>Our Solar System</h1>
        <!--Sun-->
        <h1 style="color:#856641">Sun</h1>
        <h3 >Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old star a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of our solar system.
            The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth,
            and without its energy, life as we know it could not exist here on our home planet.</h3>

        <h3 >The Sun is the largest object in our solar system.
            The Suns volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it. Its gravity holds the solar system together,
            keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it.
            The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius).
            The Sun activity, from its powerful eruptions to the steady stream of charged particles it sends out,
            influences the nature of space throughout the solar system.</h3>

        <!--Mercury-->
        <h1 style="color:#856641">Mercury</h1> 
        <h3>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.</h3>

        <h3>From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth,
            and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun,
            Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.
            Because of Mercury's elliptical egg-shaped orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's
            surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset.</h3>

        <!--Venus-->
        <h1 style="color:#856641">Venus</h1>
        <h3>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth's closest planetary neighbor. It's one of the four inner,
            terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it's often called Earth's twin because it's similar in size and density.
            These are not identical twins, however there are radical differences between the two worlds.</h3>

        <h3>Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it's perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat,
            causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It's the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun.
            Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) hot enough to melt lead.
            The surface is a rusty color and it's peppered with intensely crunched mountains and thousands of large volcanoes.
            Scientists think it's possible some volcanoes are still active. <br> Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it's
